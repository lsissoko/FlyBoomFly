Fly Boom Fly
============

This is the source code of [Fly Boom Fly](http://www.kongregate.com/games/sissokogames/fly-boom-fly), a game I made last summer on top of [Skeleton](https://github.com/Rolpege/Skeleton) and [FlashPunk](https://github.com/Draknek/FlashPunk).

The code's not too complicated and I think it could be helpful for those who are new to game programming with FlashPunk.
