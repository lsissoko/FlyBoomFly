Fly-Boom-Fly
============
This is the source code of Fly Boom Fly, a game I made last summer which can be played here: [Fly Boom Fly on Kongregate] (http://www.kongregate.com/games/sissokogames/fly-boom-fly)

------------
It's rather simple and it is organized in the vein of [Rolpege] (https://github.com/Rolpege)'s [Skeleton] (https://github.com/Rolpege/Skeleton) class. I think it could be helpful for people who are new to FlashPunk.

I've also included the version of FlashPunk that I used for this game (FP 1.5 I think)
